# Word-Guess-Game
Hangman game 

Guess the word :). Players can start playing by pressing any key. On guessing the correct letter the game will start revealing them so it gets easier to guess the entire name. 
After the user wins/loses the game will automatically choose another word to play again.

### ISSUES 
* the number of chances isn't working as expected in case if the letter are guessed wrong. 
* when all the letters are guessed right the number of changes works as expected.
